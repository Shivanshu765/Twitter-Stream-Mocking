KAFKA (LEARNINGS):

ADVANTAGES AND ARCHITECTURE OF KAFKA:

1. Kafka is an open source stream processing platform (EVENT STORE) that handles data feeds with
   low latency and high throughput
2. It holds the data in an immutable append-only structure called topics
3. Its immutability ensures that there will always be history of data feeds saved
4. Kafka is fast, resilient, scalable and works with high throughput
5. *** IT IS RESILIENT AS IT WORKS ON FILE SYSTEM INSTEAD OF MEMORY AND KEEPS ALL MESSAGES ON DISK ***
6. **IT IS FAULT-TOLERANT AS it keeps configured amount of REPLICAS TO PREVENT DATA LOSS IN CASE OF FAILURE**
7.  IT IS FAST AS IT RELIES ON DISK CACHING AND **MEMORY MAPPED FILES** OF UNDERLYING OS
8. IN MEMORY MAPPED FILE CONTAINS CONTENTS OF A FILE IN VIRTUAL MEMORY.
   THE MAPPING BETWEEN A FILE AND MEMORY SPACE ENABLES AN APPLICATION TO MODIFY THE FILE BY READING
   AND WRITING DIRECTLY TO MEMORY
9. ACCESSING MEMORY MAPPED FILES IS FASTER THAN USING DIRECT READ AND WRITE OPERATIONS AS IT OPERATES ON MEMORY

FACT : IN MOST OPERATING SYSTEMS, THE MEMORY REGION ASSIGNED TO A MAPPED FILE ACTUALLY IS IN PAGE'S CACHE(FASTER)

10. SCALE BY PARTITION
11. ORDERING GUARANTEED INSIDE A SINGLE PARTITION


HIGH AVAILABILITY : ELIMINATES SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE BY HAVING BROKERS ON DIFFERENT SERVERS
